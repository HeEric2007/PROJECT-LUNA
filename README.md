# PROJECT:LUNA

Luna is a unique financial management application catered towards younger audiences. 
It will have many features that prioritize user friendliness, 
which will be listed below for our developers.

## General Information

### Pie Chart

Luna will feature a unique pie-chart visual system that allows the user to view how much they are spending and how close they are to hitting the limit for a day/week/month. It will be similar to how many financial reports are given on paper except it is much more interactive.

### Calendar System

Luna will feature a unique calendar system, that motivates the user to continue staying on track based off of the budget they set. It will count the streak of how long the user maintains it's budget goals, which is both shown in text form as well as on the calendar with green check and red x marks to indicate if the goal was hit on that specific day.

### Smart Goals

Luna will feature a system that hasn't been seen in many other successful finance applications. The "Smart Goal" system aims to allow the user to set an item they want to purchase sometime in the future, which adjusts their budget accordingly to comfortably afford that item. Users will also be able to set how long they plan on accomplishing the "Smart Goal".

### Other features

Luna will have features that haven't been listed here by the time it's ready to launch. These features will be brainstormed by the development team overtime, but the priority will always be user friendliness, the easier it is to use the better it will be to match the original vision of the application.
